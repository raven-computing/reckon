As opposed to the more traditional physical lines of code metric, logical lines
of code focuses on how many meaningful lines exist. For example, a single
statement would count as one logical line of code, regardless of how many
physical lines the statemenet spans across. This makes the LLC metric more
unaffected by arbitrary style-related decisions that can be different
between software projects.
